An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics are replaced by the beast's statistics, but it retains its alignment and personality. The creature is limited in actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can't speak, cast spells, or take any action requiring hands or speech. The target's gear melds into the new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed."}]]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
