Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the duplicates. Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack targets you or one of your duplicates. With three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher. A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed."}]]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
